# GRIF_Notepad++_UDL.xml

This is a User Defined Language file for the Notepad++ editor. It color-codes the various GRIF syntax items to make it more readable. It is designed for the DarkModeDefault style, so if you use another style you may need to adjust the colors. See the Notepad++ application for more information on how to add and use User Defined Languages.
